A man of honor, he only makes objects for customers who own parent NFTs. His accessories are 1 of 1 digital objects that will only be created once.\r\n\r\nLife is good. But he’s still required to pay for protection to keep his shop open. It’s better than the alternative. After what happened last summer, he can’t let that happen again.\r\n\r\nVisit [10ktf.com](https://10ktf.com) to learn more.","imageUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pyp53Pww5B2BvzOhN06mXQQWttj8j6nwj-SK9M6faFS1k-VYKQ_knLCgtwOcE4GHIZlli4xgwJqxBmzoh8K-FwuGOQikyV_7fOKdHA=s120","connectedTwitterUsername":null,"assetContracts":{"edges":[{"node":{"chain":"ETHEREUM","id":"QXNzZXRDb250cmFjdFR5cGU6MzIwOTg4","blockExplorerLink":"https://etherscan.io/address/0x0cfb5d82be2b949e8fa73a656df91821e2ad99fd","chainData":{"blockExplorerName":"ETHERSCAN"},"address":"0x0cfb5d82be2b949e8fa73a656df91821e2ad99fd"}}]},"contract_address":"0x0cfb5d82be2b949e8fa73a656df91821e2ad99fd"},"tokens":[{"tokenId":"281479271678153","firstTime":"2022-05-26T18:29:51+00:00","receivers":["0xf0848ba8722a6f7bc95cafe33f3d8fb1f451bbe1"],"senders":["0x98eff5deee2e0a9205423f2f796ec88d1d99b2d9"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"281479271682799","firstTime":"2022-05-26T18:29:51+00:00","receivers":["0xf0848ba8722a6f7bc95cafe33f3d8fb1f451bbe1"],"senders":["0x98eff5deee2e0a9205423f2f796ec88d1d99b2d9"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"42949678364","firstTime":"2022-05-19T03:45:49+00:00","receivers":["0x27663b0cbb93e9dc93c3b317787944f52c4a397d"],"senders":["0x5c78c1bc0b42b2d5e676c0ed0c115fb569c904a5"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"51539611018","firstTime":"2022-06-19T18:23:57+00:00","receivers":["0x6a2142b66b8d5c991c3699955e254a8b804d3e44","0x7fe421a8fc84d3c58548e32f5d5fb7a7d5757e55"],"senders":["0x1399c6a2822b86618283789ea5b7efaf632445bf","0x6a2142b66b8d5c991c3699955e254a8b804d3e44"],"source_hackers":["0x6A2142B66B8D5C991c3699955e254A8B804d3E44","0x6A2142B66B8D5C991c3699955e254A8B804d3E44"]}]}
