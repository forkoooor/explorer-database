After all, she’s three. Susie is the child of an overachieving mother (French chef, airline pilot and doctor) and a cartoon-writing dad (of the famous “Dummi Bears” series). Susie is energetic, optimistic and quick to offer friendly advice and reassurance to a distressed Rugrat. Susie stands up for what’s right – which often puts her right in Angelica’s way.\n\n[Paramount EULA](https://paramount.xyz/license-agreement)\n\n© 2022 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
