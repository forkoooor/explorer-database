He’s the kind of guy who always goes out of his way to help those in need and stand up for what he thinks is right. As the calm center of the craziness around him, level-headed Arnold has a gift for giving advice or helping others overcome an obstacle. When he makes a mistake, he feels obligated to fix it. He may not have much power in the world at large, but that doesn’t stop him from taking risks, righting wrongs and solving problems. His sensitive, artistic and imaginative nature makes for some highly creative solutions. You never know how Arnold will get out of messes -- you just know that he will.\n\n[Paramount EULA](https://paramount.xyz/license-agreement)\n\n© 2022 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
