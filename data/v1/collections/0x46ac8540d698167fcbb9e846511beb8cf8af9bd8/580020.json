Working with light and shadow is to\nbecome aware of how they describe our reality.\n\nCreated over the past eight months, this collection has been my safe haven from the world. A finger on the\npulse of something deeper than the chaotic rhythm of daily life, an album of captive sunlight and\nexperiences preserved in blue. The stillness of winter sunlight, silent rolling waves, a slow, even breath. I\nhope you too can find solace here.","external_link":"https://quantum.art","asset_contract":{"address":"0x46ac8540d698167fcbb9e846511beb8cf8af9bd8","asset_contract_type":"non-fungible","created_date":"2021-11-02T09:44:19.330482","name":"Quantum Art","nft_version":"3.0","opensea_version":null,"owner":344017023,"schema_name":"ERC721","symbol":"QART","total_supply":"0","description":"Digital Culture, Curated.
