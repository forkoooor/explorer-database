Land is required in order to build a base, train an army and attack rival bases in order to earn Gold, Oil and RUBY. Your Land NFT can be used to play the game, but can also be used to form a partnership with another player, or can simply be rented out to others for passive RUBY income via the Mavia marketplace.\n\nAll land types behave the same in the game, and there is no offensive or defensive advantage to having higher rarity base. Common Land is the most frequently found base type, and it makes up 70% of the land in Mavia. Common Land has the least amount of environment decorations, the most basic type of map location and also has no extra luck factor when removing obstacles.","external_link":"https://mavia.com/nft/detail?id=4986","asset_contract":{"address":"0x4a537f61ef574153664c0dbc8c8f4b900cacbe5d","asset_contract_type":"non-fungible","created_date":"2022-02-21T04:37:57.603353","name":"Mavia Land","nft_version":"3.0","opensea_version":null,"owner":259327942,"schema_name":"ERC721","symbol":"LAND","total_supply":null,"description":"Heroes of Mavia is a play-to-earn MMO Strategy game developed by Skrice Studios.
