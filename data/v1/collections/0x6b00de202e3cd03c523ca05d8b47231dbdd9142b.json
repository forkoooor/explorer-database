{"collection":{"floorPrice":"3.3","slug":"tom-sachs-rockets","name":"Tom Sachs: Rocket Factory - Rockets","description":"Links: https://linktr.ee/TSRocketfactory\n\nTom Sachs Rocket Factory is a trans-dimensional manufacturing plant: we use NFTs to build new NFTs. Visit: [Mars Rocks Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-mars-rocks), [Components Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-rocket-factory), [Patches Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-rocket-factory-patches-) and [Tickets Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-mothership-tickets).\n\nThis is a collection of Assembled Rockets. Only 1000 Rocket NFTs will be minted into existence, and each is given a unique name by Tom Sachs. Rockets may be Assembled from Component NFTs in the Rocket Factory Component Collection.\n\nRockets without a ‘Flame’ or ‘Pending’ graphic may still elect to launch at https://tomsachsrocketfactory.com/launch Choose a launch date and pay a fixed fee of 0.1 ETH. Tom Sachs Rocket Factory will then build and launch a “meat-space” Physical Rocket. Once launched, the completed Rocket NFT, its Physical Rocket twin, and the Video documenting its launch form a Holy Trinity; all owned by you.\n\nRocket NFT holders will gain special access to future Tom Sachs Rocket Factory phases.","imageUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M1P3gph8LEvQPemauAxGk9QLtHl4DbqCMFHpWbY7hQr6MOPaNmirpPLvJJ8gT4bzbTN6yCLW7CwSnkRTRplvgFU3NugmZOXiSh0y=s120","connectedTwitterUsername":"tsrocketfactory","assetContracts":{"edges":[{"node":{"chain":"ETHEREUM","id":"QXNzZXRDb250cmFjdFR5cGU6Mjk3MDIx","blockExplorerLink":"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b00de202e3cd03c523ca05d8b47231dbdd9142b","chainData":{"blockExplorerName":"ETHERSCAN"},"address":"0x6b00de202e3cd03c523ca05d8b47231dbdd9142b"}}]},"contract_address":"0x6b00de202e3cd03c523ca05d8b47231dbdd9142b"},"tokens":[{"tokenId":"17","firstTime":"2022-08-18T14:07:07+00:00","receivers":["0x3ebf306298877ebee9239cd0d17c890649a64ad0","0xf7c0675967f5b9842af4994ece771acfd39c0f6d"],"senders":["0xf7c0675967f5b9842af4994ece771acfd39c0f6d","0x1cc9a0de7a659f01dbb4b47967ac0fe46454d0e7"],"source_hackers":["0xeEe495d9FA356175623E227546CBE46DFFDaF6F2","0xeEe495d9FA356175623E227546CBE46DFFDaF6F2"]}]}
