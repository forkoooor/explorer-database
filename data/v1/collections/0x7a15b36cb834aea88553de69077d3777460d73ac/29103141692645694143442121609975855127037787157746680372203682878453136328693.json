Each image in the series displays a cluster of chosen “dream sequences,” as the artist goes through serendipitous allusions to modern visual expressions in the machine-mind. \n\nCollectors who acquire three artworks from the “Dreams” series as of December 1, 2021 will receive archival prints of their images shipped from the artist’s studio in early 2022. The prints will be 22\" high and 12.4\" wide.","external_link":"https://feralfile.com/artworks/unsupervised-machine-hallucinations-moma-dreams-h-skv","asset_contract":{"address":"0x7a15b36cb834aea88553de69077d3777460d73ac","asset_contract_type":"non-fungible","created_date":"2021-11-24T06:52:02.604614","name":"Feral File — Unsupervised","nft_version":"3.0","opensea_version":null,"owner":103627358,"schema_name":"ERC721","symbol":"FF009","total_supply":"0","description":"Unsupervised is part of Machine Hallucinations, Refik Anadol Studio’s ongoing project exploring data aesthetics based on collective visual memories.
