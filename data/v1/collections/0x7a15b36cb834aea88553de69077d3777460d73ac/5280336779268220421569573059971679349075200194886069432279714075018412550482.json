The artist and his team used MoMA archives to construct the seven dimensions of the artwork: x, y, z, r, g, b, and time. It combines Anadol’s vision of handling data within a universe that it creates for itself with his approach to data visualization’s latent space as a locus for never-ending, self-generating contemplation. Researcher Leland McInnes, the inventor of the UMAP technique that Anadol has used for “Unsupervised — Data Universe — MoMA” wrote, “I have always found beauty in mathematics, but to see what Refik has done with mathematics and these algorithms to create art is something else again: bringing together rich threads of information and data to weave amazing visual works. I never imagined that my work in mathematics could have such far reaching impacts.”","external_link":"https://feralfile.com/artworks/unsupervised-data-universe-moma-jkn","asset_contract":{"address":"0x7a15b36cb834aea88553de69077d3777460d73ac","asset_contract_type":"non-fungible","created_date":"2021-11-24T06:52:02.604614","name":"Feral File — Unsupervised","nft_version":"3.0","opensea_version":null,"owner":103627358,"schema_name":"ERC721","symbol":"FF009","total_supply":"0","description":"Unsupervised is part of Machine Hallucinations, Refik Anadol Studio’s ongoing project exploring data aesthetics based on collective visual memories.
