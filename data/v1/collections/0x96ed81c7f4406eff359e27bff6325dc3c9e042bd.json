The project started as an educational endeavour. Benyamin created all the base and trait layers for the whales (normal, zombie, ape, alien), he then generated 3350 unique digital collectibles programmatically using an open-source Python script.\n\nThe project success and backstory forms a core part of early NFT, generative art and digital collectible history.
