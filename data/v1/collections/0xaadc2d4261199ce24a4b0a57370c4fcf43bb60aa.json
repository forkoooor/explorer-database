{"collection":{"floorPrice":"5.685","slug":"thecurrency","name":"Damien Hirst - The Currency","description":"HENI is delighted to present The Currency, the first NFT collection by Damien Hirst. \n\nStarting with the creation of the physical artworks in 2016, The Currency explores the boundaries of art and currencyâ€”when art changes and becomes a currency, and when currency becomes art.\n\nCollectors had 1 year to decide between the digital NFT or the physical artwork, both of which are artworks in their own right. Whichever was picked, the other got burned.\n\nAfter the Exchange deadline, on 27th July 2022, the final NFT Supply is 4,851 NFTs. 5,149 NFTs were burned in exchange for the physical artworks. \n\nThe collection was launched on the Palm blockchain, which is a token-powered ecosystem for NFTs connected to Ethereum. It is 99% more energy efficient than proof of work systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. The Currency NFTs can be moved to Ethereum using the Palm NFT Bridge.\n\nThe entire collection can be viewed by visiting https://currency.nft.heni.com/","imageUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q3G1qQKz97idjTwIJB9Enz3D4LDvL_DbwnHCP9YgVjTL4TLh7tAWUwGLPExniqGlfgLXRX-bOHRgGOb7oNOAHoeQWz2-CPLwDuaHRw=s120","connectedTwitterUsername":"HENI","assetContracts":{"edges":[{"node":{"chain":"ETHEREUM","id":"QXNzZXRDb250cmFjdFR5cGU6Mjk1MDM0","blockExplorerLink":"https://etherscan.io/address/0xaadc2d4261199ce24a4b0a57370c4fcf43bb60aa","chainData":{"blockExplorerName":"ETHERSCAN"},"address":"0xaadc2d4261199ce24a4b0a57370c4fcf43bb60aa"}}]},"contract_address":"0xaadc2d4261199ce24a4b0a57370c4fcf43bb60aa"},"tokens":[{"tokenId":"5973","firstTime":"2022-09-19T16:23:11+00:00","receivers":["0x3b37e90a131d8c531903bf16d005254345677d04"],"senders":["0xf4a4d40f918b1713cd11b24b87e1c45dd069a432"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"732","firstTime":"2022-09-18T06:19:11+00:00","receivers":["0x44096b189e3c6a8ca0408fdac608234abbf84b19"],"senders":["0x7374b5122482873371939a0a0cfeb8489c2c799e"],"source_hackers":["0x38313c0668C897b6D591A69E0A9FDc9305e67b55"]}]}
