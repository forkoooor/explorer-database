{"collection":{"floorPrice":"0.06","slug":"avastar","name":"Avastars","description":"Avastars (est. in Feb. 2020) are generative characters for the metaverse. Each one is unique and has their art and metadata stored on-chain. Avastars come licensed for use commercially by their owners. Collect Avastar Primes to make Replicants with their trait copies. IMPORTANT: When someone uses/burns a trait copy from an Avastar Prime, OpenSea shows “-Burned” after the trait name. ALWAYS CLICK ON A TRAIT TO SEE IF IT’S COPY IS BURNED BEFORE PURCHASE IF THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. There is also a “MINT CONDITION” trait. All Avastars #0-25,199 are Avastar Primes. #25,200+ are Avastar Replicants. You cannot make a Replicant with another Replicant’s traits, and no 2 Avastar Primes or Replicants can ever be the same. You can also see whether an Avastar is a Prime or a Replicant under the “Wave” category. For more info, visit the Avastars Discord.","imageUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nqAH3M0pky9XgNVA5p2rCplmpNX-K3F2aH1CMQ9i30ILpTklFW-lAhbMMXdDOQvLynbQqh883ivRwAjbz7_-59Jo=s60","connectedTwitterUsername":"AvaStarsNFT","assetContracts":{"edges":[{"node":{"chain":"ETHEREUM","id":"QXNzZXRDb250cmFjdFR5cGU6NTA0NjI=","blockExplorerLink":"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf3e778f839934fc819cfa1040aabacecba01e049","chainData":{"blockExplorerName":"ETHERSCAN"},"address":"0xf3e778f839934fc819cfa1040aabacecba01e049"}}]},"contract_address":"0xf3e778f839934fc819cfa1040aabacecba01e049"},"tokens":[{"tokenId":"10018","firstTime":"2022-07-23T04:52:15+00:00","receivers":["0x562607a01a12e84a4abe025ac14ab1e36b76519f"],"senders":["0xb1551afc5ffb7213b0d6f6bfcb17c96cec0068fe"],"source_hackers":["0xE5e5a2926b282A9b19015b212cF2974bdF5BBa08"]},{"tokenId":"11346","firstTime":"2022-07-23T07:00:24+00:00","receivers":["0x562607a01a12e84a4abe025ac14ab1e36b76519f"],"senders":["0xb1551afc5ffb7213b0d6f6bfcb17c96cec0068fe"],"source_hackers":["0xE5e5a2926b282A9b19015b212cF2974bdF5BBa08"]},{"tokenId":"23713","firstTime":"2022-07-22T14:28:20+00:00","receivers":["0x850aa3d0aa230ebf036f29693f4adc62c4792538","0xbd1d297402f091c190d6d403033a5fb49145aad3","0xdec2112c0735b3cb2ecdb6db6fbed4f844947ef9"],"senders":["0xb5265dfd2f2462b85494b13a5fe6f0d1e8b734bc","0xdec2112c0735b3cb2ecdb6db6fbed4f844947ef9","0x850aa3d0aa230ebf036f29693f4adc62c4792538"],"source_hackers":["0x05584179486314536837E181D725E56560044Bc7","0x05584179486314536837E181D725E56560044Bc7","0x05584179486314536837E181D725E56560044Bc7"]},{"tokenId":"9407","firstTime":"2022-07-18T03:46:13+00:00","receivers":["0x6969353efb7e6c326277201ccec16e4956cb4859"],"senders":["0xc6d3d90131623814d5b4f30de68ef15419c7da77"],"source_hackers":["0x05584179486314536837E181D725E56560044Bc7"]}]}
