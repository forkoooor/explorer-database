{"collection":{"floorPrice":"0.0739","slug":"avastar","name":"Avastars","description":"Avastars (est. in Feb. 2020) are generative characters for the metaverse. Each one is unique and has their art and metadata stored on-chain. Avastars come licensed for use commercially by their owners. Collect Avastar Primes to make Replicants with their trait copies. IMPORTANT: When someone uses/burns a trait copy from an Avastar Prime, OpenSea shows “-Burned” after the trait name. ALWAYS CLICK ON A TRAIT TO SEE IF IT’S COPY IS BURNED BEFORE PURCHASE IF THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. There is also a “MINT CONDITION” trait. All Avastars #0-25,199 are Avastar Primes. #25,200+ are Avastar Replicants. You cannot make a Replicant with another Replicant’s traits, and no 2 Avastar Primes or Replicants can ever be the same. You can also see whether an Avastar is a Prime or a Replicant under the “Wave” category. For more info, visit the Avastars Discord.","imageUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nqAH3M0pky9XgNVA5p2rCplmpNX-K3F2aH1CMQ9i30ILpTklFW-lAhbMMXdDOQvLynbQqh883ivRwAjbz7_-59Jo=s60","connectedTwitterUsername":"AvaStarsNFT","assetContracts":{"edges":[{"node":{"chain":"ETHEREUM","id":"QXNzZXRDb250cmFjdFR5cGU6NTA0NjI=","blockExplorerLink":"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf3e778f839934fc819cfa1040aabacecba01e049","chainData":{"blockExplorerName":"ETHERSCAN"},"address":"0xf3e778f839934fc819cfa1040aabacecba01e049"}}]},"contract_address":"0xf3e778f839934fc819cfa1040aabacecba01e049"},"tokens":[{"tokenId":"12668","firstTime":"2022-07-27T16:23:11+00:00","receivers":["0xb1fdecd172b029814d7bf73cca19f2cbde83a6ba"],"senders":["0xc26f4c5abfd4a94c830431d998a581a2160c17bf"],"source_hackers":["0x3245E504d75E4148a491BaAC5066B0F26965567D"]},{"tokenId":"13074","firstTime":"2022-06-16T22:24:42+00:00","receivers":["0x6a2142b66b8d5c991c3699955e254a8b804d3e44"],"senders":["0x32b232e3327909d36bea7aae406690fb7a4546cf"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"17209","firstTime":"2022-06-16T22:24:42+00:00","receivers":["0x6a2142b66b8d5c991c3699955e254a8b804d3e44"],"senders":["0x32b232e3327909d36bea7aae406690fb7a4546cf"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"20607","firstTime":"2022-07-27T16:23:11+00:00","receivers":["0xb1fdecd172b029814d7bf73cca19f2cbde83a6ba"],"senders":["0xc26f4c5abfd4a94c830431d998a581a2160c17bf"],"source_hackers":["0x3245E504d75E4148a491BaAC5066B0F26965567D"]},{"tokenId":"22566","firstTime":"2022-06-28T16:56:09+00:00","receivers":["0x64ec1cf0f4f315e95a1da0f113240db4a6ea2bad"],"senders":["0x1ea43ecae1bea39fd354f6e4ea3fc1204497fe7f"],"source_hackers":[null]},{"tokenId":"25496","firstTime":"2022-07-27T16:23:11+00:00","receivers":["0xb1fdecd172b029814d7bf73cca19f2cbde83a6ba"],"senders":["0xc26f4c5abfd4a94c830431d998a581a2160c17bf"],"source_hackers":["0x3245E504d75E4148a491BaAC5066B0F26965567D"]},{"tokenId":"26026","firstTime":"2022-06-16T22:24:23+00:00","receivers":["0x6a2142b66b8d5c991c3699955e254a8b804d3e44"],"senders":["0x32b232e3327909d36bea7aae406690fb7a4546cf"],"source_hackers":[null]}]}
